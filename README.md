Traditional diabetes prediction struggles with data limitations and complexity. Random Forest, a powerful machine learning method, offers a promising solution. The data-mining model leverages Random Forest and Bagging to identify individuals at risk.

This section explains the proposed mechanism for diabetes prediction. The model uses a diabetes dataset containing features such as blood pressure, cholesterol, skin thickness, BMI, and sugar levels. The dataset is processed and relevant features are extracted using a trained model. Diabetes is then classified into two classes (1 or 2) using data mining techniques, specifically Bagging and Random Forest classifiers.
The results are analyzed to understand the model’s predictions and the contribution of each feature. After achieving satisfactory performance, the model is deployed to predict diabetes on new and unseen data. Regular evaluation and updates are performed to maintain accuracy and reliability. The model’s performance is validated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and confusion matrix.
